## Hi there 👋, I'm Megha

🎨 A Little About Me

Welcome to my digital workshop—a place where code meets creativity and every project is a new adventure! I'm a software developer with a knack for building intuitive, functional, and downright enjoyable applications that make life a little easier (and sometimes more fun!).

By day, I’m a full-stack developer diving into everything from sleek front-end designs to complex back-end logic. By night, you’ll probably find me tinkering with new tech or brainstorming features that will surprise and delight users. My love for code isn’t just about building things—it's about creating experiences that feel as good as they look.
